## todo

- [ ] fix incorrect merging of opposing edges
- [ ] fix unexpected degenerate triangles
- [ ] improve benchmark to include triangles and triangle stats (area, aspect ratio incl mean and sd)
- [ ] benchmark number of vertices/triangles relative to number of tetrahedra


## backlog

- [ ] fix bunny benchmark
- [ ] implement alternative merging algorithm
- [ ] implement normal generation
- [ ] implement sample-cube edge handling
- [ ] implement simple cubic lattice structure
- [ ] test vertex/index reservation for speedup
- [ ] parallelise vertex pass
- [ ] clean up project (organise files and structure)
- [ ] wrap with graphical interface to view models live


## done

**Complete**
- [ ] implement integrated merging algorithm
