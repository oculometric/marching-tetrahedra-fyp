developed for medical image/data processing
produces a polygonal representation of constant-density surfaces (isosurfaces) in 3D data
existing methods don't make good use of all the data
divide and conquer
reuses pre-computed edge interpolation values for the last cube (horizontally). mentions that memory requirements are too large otherwise.
