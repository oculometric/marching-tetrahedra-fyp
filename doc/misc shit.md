- [x] do project plan/proposal doc (include key sources)
- [x] whittle down key sources
- [x] update proposal  + add paper refs
- [x] tempalte questionnaire
- [ ] fill out ethics form
- [ ] forum
- [x] decide on what we're actually researching: what are we comparing?
no gantt charts! just do kanbans

compare body-centered-lattice vs simple cube
visual quality (user testing) vs resolution
efficiency with/without pre-computation of cell corners
explain key research sources

things to actually compare:
- perceived visual quality at different voxel resolutions ( NOT THIS )
- perceived visual quality with different vertex clustering methods (none, integrated, post-processed)
- standard deviation from average triangle area, average triangle aspect ratio
- perceived visual quality with different tessellations
- performance with different voxel resolutions
- performance with different clustering methods (as above)
- performance with different tessellations
